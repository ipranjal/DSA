# Sorting

1. The pivot used in Quicksort may have a significant impact on its performance. Some
popular options include: (50 points)
A. The first component is
B. The middle component
C. A component is chosen at random
D. The array's median element
E. The median member of the array's first three elements
Write a code that considers an example for quicksort and Comment on each of the
above options by implementing it and analyzing it. What are the advantages and
disadvantages of each? In what circumstances are they excellent or terrible ideas?

2. Assume you already have an example code for heapsort (As per your choice). Now
perform the following operation on it: (20 points)

A. Make use of the current heap code. Create a heap object, then loop over your
array of data to sort and add each item to the heap. Then, one at a time, remove
items from the heap, filling up the array from left to right (since the heap function
we developed is a min-heap).
B. Remove the present heap code and replace it with something comparable that
operates directly on the array we have.
