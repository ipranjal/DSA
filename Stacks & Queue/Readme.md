# Stack and Queue

1. WAP to implement stack using a single queue and show all the basic
operations.
2. WAP to implement an expression using stack. For example:
a. Input: str = “1 3 3 * + 9 -“
b. Output: 1
c. Explanation: If the expression is converted into an infix
expression, it will be 1 + (3 * 3) – 9 = 10 – 9 = 1
3. Implement stack using doubly linked list and show all the operations
of stack.
4. Implement a queue using a circular linked list and show all the
operations of the queue.
5. WAP to implement a queue using stacks and show all the basic
operations.
