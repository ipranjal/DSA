# LCS and Matrix Multiplication

1. WAP to implement matrix_chain_multiplication that calculate the minimum number of
scalar multiplications required to multiply the ‘n’ sequence of matrices optimally as well as gives
the order of operations.
For example:
Input: ABC are three matrices with 5x10, 10x8, 8x5 dimensions.
Output: # minimum scaler operations: 600 and the order of operations: ((AB).C)

2. WAP to implement longest_common_subsequence that calculate the length of the longest
common subsequence between the given ‘n’ strings.
For example:
Input:
Str1: abcdef
Str2: abc
Str3: cdef
Output: The length of LCS is 1, and the string is c.
