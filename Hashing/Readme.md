# Hashing 

1. WAP to implement Hashing with double hashing as a collision resolution strategy. Your
program should include – Insert, lookup, and delete operations.
2. WAP to implement Hashing with chaining as a collision resolution strategy. Your program
should include – Insert, lookup, and delete operations.
3. Determine the length of the longest subsequence within an array of integers. This
subsequence must consist of consecutive integers, and the order of these integers can be
flexible. The goal is to find the maximum length of such a subsequence while ensuring that all
distinct values are included.
Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}
Output: 4
Explanation: The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence of consecutive elements
4. Identify symmetric pairs within an array of pairs. Symmetric pairs consist of two pairs (a, b)
and (c, d) where c equals b and a equals d. For instance, (1, 2) and (2, 1) represent a
symmetric pair. This task involves finding all such symmetric pairs within the given array, with
the assumption that the first elements of all pairs are distinct.
5. WAP to check whether there are any two distinct elements within an array A[] of n numbers
whose sum is equal to a given number x.
